- **Data Exfiltration**: Extract sensitive data from compromised clients.
- **Ransomware Attack**: Encrypt files on client machines and demand a ransom.
- **Phishing Attack**: Conduct phishing operations to capture credentials.
- **SQL Injection Attack**: Perform SQL injection attacks on specified targets.
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Ensure the server's continued operation and recovery.
- **Encrypted Communications**: Secure communication between the server and clients.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and add new features.
- **Admin Panel (GUI)**: Manage the botnet through a graphical user interface.
- **Mobile App**: Monitor and control the botnet through a mobile application.

## Setup

1. **Install Rust**: Follow the instructions at [Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

    
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stalinium-server.git

## Configuration

Edit the `config.toml` file located in the `server/config.toml` directory to set up your backup servers and other settings.

Example `config.toml`:

toml
[settings]
server_address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
backup_servers = ["127.0.0.1:8081", "127.0.0.1:8082"]
encryption_key = "another_very_secret_key_abcdef1234567890"
log_directory = "/var/log/stalinium_server"
admin_panel_port = 3000
mobile_app_url = "http://localhost:4000"
```

## Usage
